VERSION 1.22
(Hope it works, not tested!)

Instalation notes
-----------------

You need to have SDL, SDL_gfx, SDL_mixer and SDL_image installed (check path
to includes and libs in Makefile).

To build from source, check PREFIX in Makefile and type

# make
# make install


Binaries (xpired, xpiredit) go into PREFIX/bin, data into PREFIX/share/xpired.
On the first run, xpired creates .xpired directory in your HOME, where it
stores your xpired.cfg and xpired.dmo (saved demo).
